# sql-eras-tour-revenue
SQL project estimating the local revenue generated by Taylor Swift's Eras Tour

## Description:
This project assesses the economic impact of Taylor Swift's Eras Tour on various cities across the US, with the goal of estimating each city's local economic gain from hosting the tour. Concert-specific revenue data for this tour has not been publically released yet, so Taylor's previous Reputation Stadium Tour is used to estimate an average ticket price for each city. "Swiftie expenses" are defined as the estimated amount that concert-goers spent on concert-related purchases like food and accommodations in their host city. The report culminates in visual representations of tax revenue and total local revenue that the tour generated in each host city.

## Tools used:
- SQL (SQLite)
- Python
- Pandas

## Analysis:
This project estimates that the Eras Tour generated between $160 million (Cincinnati) and $760 million (Los Angeles) in local revenue at each stop, depending on the city and number of shows played. The actual data from host cities is still being released in real-time, but it is worth noting that Cincinnati's own tax revenue calculations are comparable with this project's: $1.4 million (their figure) vs $1.2 million (our estimate). As more tour data is released, these calculations can be updated to reflect that information, but the overall approach provides a strong framework for music venues and city officials to predict the impact that hosting a popular tour could have on their local economy.

## Data:
- 2 years of concert data for the Eras Tour: fields include concert venue and ticket sales in count form, but not sales revenue
- 10 years of concert data for all of Taylor Swift's previous tours leading up to the Eras Tour: fields include concert venue, attendance, revenue, etc.

## Key metrics:
- Ticket sales per venue
- Average ticket cost
- Total ticket revenue
- Tax revenue from ticket sales
- "Swiftie expenses" (concert-related purchases made by fans in host city)

## Techniques demonstrated:
- Querying
- Data aggregation
- Subquerying
- Data visualization
